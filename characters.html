K is aware he is a replicant, and like the rest of his line, was programmed with implanted memories to aid his mental stability</p>

            <p>Played by: Ana de Armas</p>
            <p>Joi is an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram, designed and commercially sold by Wallace Corporation to be a fully customizable live-in romantic companion.

            <h3>"Niander Wallace"</h3>
            <p>Played by: Jared Leto</p>
            <p>Niander Wallace is the sinister CEO and founder of Wallace Corporation, which dominates replicant production in 2049. A genius genetic engineer, his genetically modified crops and livestock solved a global food crisis â€“ which then gave him enough wealth and political clout to lift the ban on replicant production. Wallace bought out the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation.</p>

            <h3>"Luv"</h3>
            <p>Played by: Sylvia Hoeks</p>
            <p>Luv is a Nexus-9 replicant and personal assistant to Niander Wallace. He entrusts her as his right-hand agent running day-to-day affairs over Wallace Corporation. As KD6-3.7 notes, Wallace was fond enough of her to give her a name (and not just a serial number like he has). She also acts as his personal enforcer, ruthlessly killing police officers in the search for Rachael's child.</p>

            <h3>"Dr. Ana Stelline"</h3>
            <p>Played by: Carla Juri</p>
            <p>Dr. Ana Stelline is a scientist who designs the implanted memories that Wallace Corporation installs into its new replicants: the replicants are aware that these memories are implants they did not personally experience, but their presence drastically improves their mental stability. Empathetic to how replicants are used as slave-labor, Ana tries to give them pleasant memories to carry with them, even if they know they're artificial.</p>

            <h3>"Freysa Sadeghpour"</h3>
            <p>Played by: Hiam Abbass</p>
            <p>Freysa Sadeghpour is the leader of the replicant underground. Apparently an older Nexus-8 model, she took care of Rachael's baby after she died in childbirth (K recognizes her in a photo of the baby from around 2022). Freysa helped to hide Rachael's child and erase the records of its past, but is organizing the underground to one day lead another replicant revolt. </p>

            <h3>"Sapper Morton"</h3>
            <p>Played by: Dave Bautista</p>
            <p>Sapper Morton is an older Nexus-8 replicant, living in seclusion on a protein farm in the industrial outliers of Los Angeles. Despite his large size and strength, he is polite and well-read, collecting antique books. K's encounter to "retire" him starts off the events of the film, as it leads K to discover Rachael's skeletal remains buried on Morton's farm.</p>
